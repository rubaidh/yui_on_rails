== Asset tag helper

* Automatic rollup of JS files if appropriate (ie if we're asking for the
  minified version and all the components are included).

* Use the YUI asset hosts if appropriate. I'm not entirely sure what
  appropriate is in this context though; definitely not in development or
  testing! Probably a configuration option to allow people to switch it on in
  production.

* Devise a sane behaviour for ":cache => true" -- we probably want to extract
  the cache option and modify it slightly so that the cached file doesn't get
  called all.js.
