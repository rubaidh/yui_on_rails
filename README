= YUI On Rails

Here is a lovely little plugin which makes it less painful to use YUI with
Rails. Coming from a Rails background, we rather like all the helpers that
make it easy to use Prototype and Scriptaculous without actually having to
write Javascript code, don't we? This will be the equivalent (as I need to use
bits of it!) for the Yahoo! UI library.
